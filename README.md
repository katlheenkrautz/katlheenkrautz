### Hi there 👋 I'm Katlheen Krautz

💼 I have 2 years of experience as a QA Engineer, working at Lone Wolf Technologies, where I focused on manual testing for web and mobile applications, API testing with Postman, SQL data validation, and bug tracking using JIRA.

🌱 I’ve recently completed several QA projects during my training at **TripleTen**, where I deepened my experience in UI testing, API validation, and test automation using Python, Pytest, and Selenium WebDriver.

🚀 **New!** I’ve added two automation projects to my portfolio:
- 🧪 [API Automation Testing Project](https://github.com/katlheenkrautz/apiautomation): Automated testing for user and kit creation using Pytest and the `requests` library. Includes positive/negative test cases, token-based authentication, and dynamic payloads.
- 🌐 [Web App UI Automation Project](https://github.com/katlheenkrautz/AutomationWebAppTest): Automated end-to-end testing of a ride-request web application using Selenium WebDriver and Page Object Model (POM). Covers real-user scenarios including form input, modal handling, and UI validation.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on QA-related projects where I can contribute through manual and automated testing, test design, bug analysis, and cross-team communication.

💬 Ask me about: software testing, QA methodologies, test case design, and agile team workflows.

⚡ Fun fact: My background is in Biomedical Engineering—now I apply that same analytical mindset to software quality!
