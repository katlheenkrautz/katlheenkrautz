### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Katlheen Krautz

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a QA Engineer at **Lone Wolf Technologies**, performing manual testing for web and mobile applications, API testing with Postman, SQL validation, and bug tracking with JIRA.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™ve recently completed several QA projects during my training at **TripleTen**, where I explored UI testing, API validation, and began learning test automation with Python, Pytest, and Selenium WebDriver.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on QA-related projects where I can contribute with manual and automated testing, bug analysis, and team communication.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: software testing, QA methodologies, test cases, and collaborative workflows.
