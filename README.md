### Hi there 👋 I'm Katlheen Krautz

🔭 I’m currently working as a QA Engineer at **Lone Wolf Technologies**, performing manual testing for web and mobile applications, API testing with Postman, SQL validation, and bug tracking with JIRA.

🌱 I’ve recently completed several QA projects during my training at **TripleTen**, where I explored UI testing, API validation, and began learning test automation with Python, Pytest, and Selenium WebDriver.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on QA-related projects where I can contribute with manual and automated testing, bug analysis, and team communication.

💬 Ask me about: software testing, QA methodologies, test cases, and collaborative workflows.
 
⚡ Fun fact: My background is in Biomedical Engineering—now I apply that same analytical mindset to software quality!
